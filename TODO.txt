 - fix create_modern_game test - probably need to make proper team files
 - develop inning function - need to handle all possible hit outcome
 - populate all reference tables
 - finish oddity function (and probably delete Oddity Enum?)
 - add player find by position to use traits for things like defense rolls
 - probably need to track which player is on base???

game_functions.rs line 529

 - refactor debug/regular roll code into core function (ex. rolls in fn modern_inning_flow())
 - refactor incrementing outs code into a core function (ex. fn actual_out() match statement)

STEAL
 - add a button in the "Game" tab next to "Next At Bat"
 - only enable button if steal conditions are met
 - "Steal" button opens menu with different steal options
