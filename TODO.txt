 - fix create_modern_game test - probably need to make proper team files
 - develop inning function - need to handle all possible hit outcome
 - populate all reference tables
 - finish oddity function (and probably delete Oddity Enum?)
 - add player find by position to use traits for things like defense rolls
 - probably need to track which player is on base???

 - update fn possible_error/productive_out1/productive_out2 to handle top/bottom inning logic
