# Deadball Game

## About
Deadball: Baseball With Dice is a table top baseball game developed by W.M. Akers.  This repo is an attempt to recreate that game in Rust, mostly as a learning opportunity (and with no affiliation with the creator), so I won't make any explanation of the rules or game mechanics.  For more information on how to play the game and purchase the rules yourself, please see the [official website](http://wmakers.net/deadball).

## Status
This game is still early in development.  As of the current release, it is possible to run through a game, but many of the rules are missing and the inteface leaves a lot to be desired.  Stay tuned for future releases.
